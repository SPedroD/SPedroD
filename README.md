My name is Stephen Diehl
I'm an Amazon employee that is taking advantage of an Amazon benefit called Career Choice. One of the paths you can take is to be certified in Data Analysis.
I'm a noob if ever there was one, but I've always been able to learn new things, so I'm happy for this opportunity.
I'm learning R and RStudio right now and I am interested in Data Science generally.
